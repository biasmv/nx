What's this?
=================================================

``nx`` measures the execution time of a shell command, similar to the ``time`` 
utility. The added value of ``nx`` is the ability to run the command more than 
once and collect statistics, that is average, min and max execution times.

Example Usage
-------------------------------------------------

Execute and measure times of 10 runs:

  nx -n 10 sleep 1
